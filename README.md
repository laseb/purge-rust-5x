My EU5x Purge Rust server configuration for any environment

## Discord setup
If you want to test anything in discord you will need to download the discord.dll file you can find on the uMod website and configure it all. The details for the discord bot being used on the server are not to be tampered with or viewed for security reasons.

## Local setup
Go to https://rust.facepunch.com/faq/ and download the zip file that will setup your local environment.

## Staging
Staging is our server we test changes on together, this will ensure that your changes to the server work as planned and nothing bad happens.

## Folders
- /plugins - This is the folder that holds all the .cs files. The configurations rely on these to work.
- /config - This is the configurations that are generated from the plugins, I strongly recommend you setup a local test server and test it on that.
